        Quick definition: when I say “responsive” what I mean is that whatever you’re styling should look nice on the range of viewports and orientations that you intend to support. In most cases that means things should look fine everything from ultrawide monitors to the smallest popular smartphones in use. (the iphone 5 is probably the smallest phone that is still getting a fair amount of use.. it’s viewport is 320px wide) If you’re working on a webapp that is specifically never going to be viewed on phones then these requirements are going to be a little different!
