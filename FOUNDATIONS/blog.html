    <h1>Understanding COALESCE () Function in SQL</h1>
    <p>
        With technology growing and evolving, it’s 
        essential to stay updated with the latest trends as a developer. 
        Whether you are a beginner or an expert, a solid understanding of string manipulation 
        helps you prepare data (for instance, generating a different form from the existing one,
         making it usable for your business) and manage it using inbuilt SQL server functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides data manipulation, you can examine data sets, evaluate data values, 
        and encode or decode them to drive more meaningful data. As a result, this 
        helps you navigate through missing values in data sets, comprehend their impact on 
        calculations, and streamline the overall working with the data process to avoid Null
         values which may ruin operation results.
    </p>
    <p>
        This guide walks you through the coalesce function in SQL, which helps 
        build complex programs. The post assumes you’ve encountered and worked with SQL 
        and just looking to reinforce your understanding of this particular function. 
        Our series of SQL guides can help you get started quickly.

    <h2>What is COALESCE () in SQL, and How is it Useful?</h2>
    <p>
        The coalesce function in SQL evaluates parameters (arguments) in a specified order,
         like lists, and returns the first non Null value. Simply put, the function assesses
          your list sequentially and terminates at the instance of the first non Null value. 
          If all arguments in the list are null, the function returns NULL. Additionally, 
          the function is inclusive and supported in other databases like MYSQL, Azure SQL Database,
           Oracle, and PostgreSQL.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use Coalesce in the following instances when:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Handling NULL values.</li>
        <li>Running several queries as one.</li>
        <li>Avoiding lengthy, time-consuming CASE statements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When used in place of CASE statements (or the ISNULL function), coalesce
         takes many parameters, unlike the CASE, which only takes two. This approach 
        lets you write less code and eases the writing process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here’s the syntax:
    </p>
    <p><em>COALESCE(valueOne, valueTwo, valueThree, …, valueX);</em></p>
